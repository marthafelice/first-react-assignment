# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

==================================QUESTION 2============================================
Features of react
-React is has a high performance 
-It uses Javascript Syntax Extension
-Virtual DOM 
-One way data binding
-Simplicity

=====================================QUESTION 3============================================
Advantages of react
-Enables creation of re-usable components
-Has dedicated tools for easy debigging
-Unidirectional data flow
-Enables development of both web and mobile apps


=======================================QUESTION 4============================================
React was created by Jordan Walke and is owned and maintained by Facebook

=====================================  QUESTION 5 ============================================
-In HTML, multiple elements can be returned.
For example:
<ul>
  <li>unordered list</li>
    <ol>
       <li>ordered list</li>
     </ol>
 </li>
 <li>unordered list</li>
 <li>unordered list</li>
</ul>
 
 Nested JSX must return one element, which weâ€™ll call a parent element that wraps all other levels of nested elements:
<div> 
  <p>pink</p>
  <p>yellow</p> 
  <p>green</p>
</div>

the project can not run without the parent div.


-HTML elements have attributes while JSX elements have props.

-In HTML almost all tags have an opening and a closing tag except probably a few like  <br/> . In JSX, however, any element can be written as a self-closing tag, for example: <div/>
Example:
const string = <img src={user.avatarUrl}  />;


=====================================  QUESTION 6 ============================================
That is because JSX is not actually JavaScript
